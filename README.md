# FScraper

temporary ReadMe

This file will take a fakku file with the naming format [artist] HManga name (group).zip and recreate it with the metadata scraped into a ComicInfo.xml in the zip file.
This will allow for proper sorting of manga in comic apps like ComicRack. There's no GUI now though so if you use it you will just have to compile it. 
Not finished but the basic functionality is working.

There will be more work done and the ReadMe will be polished up a bit more in the future.
